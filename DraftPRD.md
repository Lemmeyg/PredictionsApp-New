# 1. Core Features and Functionalities

## 1.1 Import Fixtures from Football API
###Notes
-Run the script to execute an API call at 5pm EST everyday
-Pull in all the fixtures from League 39 and season 2024

- Users can fetch upcoming matches using the API.
- **API Example**:
  - **Request**:
    ```javascript
    axios.get('/api/matches/upcoming');
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "username": "user1",
        "matchId": 1,
        "homeTeam": "Team A",
        "awayTeam": "Team B",
        "homeTeamScore": 1, // this will be the score of the home team
        "awayTeamScore": 2,
        "round": 12,
        "status": "not Started",
        "startTime": "2024-01-15T15:00:00Z"
      }
    ]
    ```
## 1.2 Store the Fixtures in the GoogleSheet "Fixtures" Table
The process for storing fixtures in Airtable follows these steps:

1.2.1. Clear existing data:
   - Fetch all existing records from the "Fixtures" table
   - Use batching wherever possible (https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/batch)
   - Delete records in batches
   - Log the number of records deleted

1.2.2. Import new data:
   - Process fixtures in batches  (https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/guides/batch)
- there will be a maximum number of 380 records for the fixtures
 - Each record contains:
     - fixtureid: unique identifier
     - homeTeam: name of home team
     - awayTeam: name of away team
     - round: match round number
     - status: match status
     - startTime: scheduled start time
     - homeTeamScore: current/final score (if available)
     - awayTeamScore: current/final score (if available)
   - Log successful insertion of new records

1.2.3. Error handling:
   - Comprehensive error logging for both deletion and insertion operations
   - Batch processing ensures reliable operation within API limits
   - Transaction-like behavior: if insertion fails, the process can be safely retried

This process is automatically handled by the updateFixturesInAirtable function and runs as part of the daily fixture update routine.

##1.3 import current game week fixtures
-Worksheet 1OJpcocsLUD-5CUGTZcaNJzJ2ZyHw-hG-ryXUo25Ro7E/edit?gid=2008750902#gid=2008750902
Table = predictions
-Columns headers are: Fixture ID, Round, Date, Starttime, Home Team, Away Team,
-Current game week is defined as the lowest numbered round where all fixtures status is NS
-There will be up to 20 fixtures per import
-Add the records to the bottom of the table
-Import the fixtures into the Predictions form
-Include the screenshot

## 1.4 Prediction Submission
-They will predict the number of goals the home team and the away team will score.
-The user will use the predictions page to submit predictions for the score of all fixtures in the next game week
-A game week is also known as round.
- when the user clicks on the submit button the data is sent to the Googelsheets "Predictions" table.
- the column headers are username,fixtureid, home team, away team, home team score, away team score, round
-These predictions will be stores in the googlesheets "predictions' Table
-When the user enters a single numeric character into the input field for a score it will automatically move to the next input field for a score.
-If a user has already submitted predictions for a specific round they will not be able to submit predictions for the same round again.
-If a user has not entered in a score in each field it will not allow them to submit the prediction.

##1.5 Leaderboard
The leaderboard shows the data in the googelsheets "leaderboard" table
It will display record in order of "rank" with lowest number at the top of the table.

â€”
# 2.UX and Front end

## 2.1 Home Page
- Display a welcome message.
- Provide buttons to:
  - Enter predictions - this will take the user to the user page.
  - View the leaderboard - this will take the user to the leaderboard page.

  ### 2.1.1 User Page
  - the function of this page is to allow the user to select their name from a number of icons displaying one for each name of the players.
  - this will represent to player that the user is predicting for.
- it will include a "Back' button that the user can use to return to the home page
  - there are currently 6 players in the database.
  - the users names are:
    -"David"
    -"Gordon"
    -"Huw"
    -"James"
    -"Tom"
    -"Ty"  
  
## 2.3 Enter Predictions
The logic for this screen will be run everytime the screen loads. 
-Users can enter predictions for all matches in the next round only.
- The fixtures to be displayed are loaded from the "GameWeek" sheet in googlesheets document.
- this sheet should be refreshed everytime before the data is loaded into the application.

  - Matches data will be fetched from the fixtures table via the googlesheets API.
**Layout**
- the screen should contain a "change user" button in the top right of the screen
  - the user name will displayed in the top left of the screen.
  - it will display the home team on the left and the away team on the right with two blank numeric input fields in the middle
  - the user will be able to click on the blank field to enter their prediction.
  - when the user input a single character numeric value into the first blank field, it will move onto the next blank field.-
  - once all the fields are filled the user will be able to click on the submit button to submit their predictions.
  

  ###2.3.1 Submit Predictions
  - the user will be able to click on the submit button to submit their predictions.
  - when they submit their predictions they will be shown a toast notification containing all their predictions in one message so they can take a screen shot.
  - display teh toast notice for 3 seconds before returning the user to the home page.
  - all predictions will be stored in the same googlesheets workbook as the fixtures, on a table titled "predictions". 
  - the predictions table will have the following columns:
    - userName: name of user
    - fixtureId: unique identifier matching the fixtureId in the fixtures table
    - homeTeam: name of home team
    - awayTeam: name of away team
    - homeTeamScore: predicted score of home team
    - awayTeamScore: predicted score of away team
    - round: match round number
    -date
  - note that there are other columns in the table but these are the ones that are to be updated. ignore the existing columns.
  - never write over any existing rows.

## 2.4 View Predictions
- Users can view predictions made by all users for the current game week.
- **Definition of current game week**:
  - The game week with the lowest number where at least one match is scheduled to start later than `NOW` and has a status: `not Started`.

## 2.5.1 Leaderboard page
###2.5.1.1 Layout
 - the leaderboard should follow the same design language and color scheme as the rest of the application.
 - the leaderboard should be responsive and should look good on both laptop and mobile devices.
 - it should contain a "Back" button in the top left of the screen that the user can use to return to the home page.  

 ###2.5.1.2 Table
 - the top frame should be titled "Leaderboard"
 - the top frame should show a table with the following columns:
      - Rank
      - Player
      - Total Points
      - Points from the previous game week
  - the table should be sorted by total points, highest to lowest.
- data to populate this table will come from googlesheets "leaderBoard" sheet.

# 3. Project Setup and Best Practices

## 3.1 Project Setup
- All new components should go in `/components` at the root (not in the app folder) and be named like `example-cor`.
- All new pages go in `/app`.
- Use the Next.js 14 App Router.
- All data fetching should be done in a server component and passed down as props.
- Client components (using `useState`, hooks, etc.) require the `'use client'` directive at the top of the file.

## 3.2 Server-Side API Calls
- All interactions with external APIs (e.g., Reddit, OpenAI) should be performed server-side.
- Create dedicated API routes in the `pages/api` directory for each external API interaction.
- Client-side components should fetch data through these API routes, not directly from external APIs.

## 3.3 Environment Variables
- Store all sensitive information (API keys, credentials) in environment variables.
- Use an `.env.local` file for local development and ensure it is listed in `.gitignore`.
- For production, set environment variables in the deployment platform (e.g., Vercel).
- Access environment variables only in server-side code or API routes.

## 3.4 Error Handling and Logging
- Implement comprehensive error handling in both client-side components and server-side API routes.
- Log errors on the server-side for debugging purposes.
- Display user-friendly error messages on the client-side.

## 3.5 Type Safety
- Use TypeScript interfaces for all data structures, especially API responses.
- Avoid using the `any` type to ensure type safety.

## 3.6 API Client Initialization
- Initialize API clients as needed to streamline server-side interactions and reduce redundancy.


#5 file structure. 
- where possible keep the file structure and organization as simple as possible. 
- here is a suggestion for the file structure. â”œâ”€â”€ .env.local

Key organizational principles:

1. **App Directory Structure**
   - All pages are organized under `src/app/` following Next.js 14 App Router conventions
   - Each major feature has its own directory with related components

2. **Components Organization**
   - Components are grouped by feature area (predictions, leaderboard, etc.)
   - Shared components are placed in the `shared` directory
   - Layout components have their own directory

3. **API and Data Handling**
   - API integrations are centralized in `lib/api`
   - TypeScript interfaces are organized in `lib/types`
   - Helper functions are grouped in `lib/utils`

4. **Configuration**
   - Environment variables in `.env.local`
   - Constants and API configuration in `config` directory

5. **Static Assets**
   - All static files (images, icons) are stored in `public`
   - User avatars have a dedicated directory

6. **Utility Scripts**
   - Background jobs and scripts are stored in `scripts`
   - Includes the daily fixture update script

This structure follows React/Next.js best practices and ensures:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy navigation and maintenance
- Scalability for future features
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Proper organization of server and client components
